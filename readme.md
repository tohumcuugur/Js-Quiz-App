This is a javascript quiz application. In the application, 10 seconds are given for each question and there are 15 questions. If the answer is not marked at the end of the time, the correct answer is automatically marked. If the answer is not marked, the next question button will not appear after the specified time has elapsed. I aimed to better understand the constructor structure with this application.
